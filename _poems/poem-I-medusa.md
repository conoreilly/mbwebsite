> I, Medusa,  
I am used  
To every juicy, every venom-laden insult you can hurl;  
I’ve heard them all.  
Once, when I was young, intact,  
My girlish hair smooth, sleek, still, black,  
Unwilling I could still attract.  
O how the lowly fall!  
>
>I, Medusa,  
I am used  
To the abuse from all the folk who follow what they think’s my tale.  
That news is fake:  
Snaky, coiling, noisy hair;  
Vicious, petrifying stare;  
Born a monster; never fair:  
Miss taken – my mistake!  
>
>I, Medusa,  
I am used  
 To the untruths and to the loose interpretation of my acts.  
Misunderstood.  
My stony gaze and frozen heart  
Immortalised their mortal part.  
Were I a man, this would be art:  
Blessed instead of cursed.  
>
>I, Medusa,  
I am used  
To Zeus-like warriors stopped in their tracks, their sudden stricken eyes.  
Look – preservation!  
Statues wicked, poised, confused –  
They should be toppled and abused,  
But I, Medusa – I am used!  
My mob decapitation.
