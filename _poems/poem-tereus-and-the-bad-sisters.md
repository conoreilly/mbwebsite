>I could have used some honeyed words, some chat-up line, some coaxing voice;  
I could have promised stardom, glory, fame –  
But force, I’ve found, works faster.  
Sisters, you both look the same;  
There’s hardly difference in your name;  
So tell me, really, where’s the blame?  
My role is lord and master.  
>
>Was I not fair? Did I not warn you, “Don’t resist me!”? Sister, I insisted.  
But would you listen? No, you cried and screamed;  
You threatened and you whined.  
So, like a monster needing slain,  
I sliced right through your lingual vein.  
Since then, I’ve not heard you complain.  
Not all men are so kind.

>That should have been the story’s end; her cancelled lines, removed off stage,  
But women weave and fabricate their hurt,  
Their tales of accusation:  
That I, me too, should be abhorred:  
That act should win her an award;  
Her needle mightier than my sword.  
Such sly communication.  
>
>They’ve had their say and stitched me up, depicted me the villain of the piece.  
Yet villains often win – that’s hard to swallow,  
The status quo resumed.  
I’m still the king, the throne’s mine still;  
Tereus – one, the sisters – nil;  
The stage is mine alone until  
The Sun itself’s consumed.
